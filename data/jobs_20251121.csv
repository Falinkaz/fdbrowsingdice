Purpose of the Team: The purpose of this team is to manage infrastructure for service functionality, game streaming, managing consoles and creating tools to simplify the developer experience around those resources, as well as making sure that there's consistency in how people use them and compliance in terms of security and other vulnerability requirements.

Key projects: This role will help abstract, maintain, and evolve shared infrastructure-SDLC tooling, hosting (compute/observability/availability), and service infrastructure (secrets, databases, etc.)-so product teams can ship faster with higher reliability. Our purpose is to make infrastructure easy and safe for service developers by delivering paved roads, automation, and guidance.

o Typical task breakdown and operating rhythm: A typical day for a team member blends operational vigilance with platform engineering: the morning starts with a standup to align priorities and review dashboards for alerts or incidents, followed by deep technical work such as updating Terraform modules, refining CI/CD pipelines, and improving AKS clusters or ingress configurations.

Typical day often involves troubleshooting telemetry gaps, tuning alerts, and collaborating with partner teams to unblock deployments or guide migrations. Throughout the day, members document fixes, update TSGs, and share knowledge, while staying ready to join incident bridges if needed.

The role emphasizes automation, reliability, and cross-team collaboration to keep our service infrastructure secure, scalable, and resilient.

o What makes this role interesting? - This role provides the opportunity to work with modern tech stack and work in a space that has direct impact on the future of the gaming industry.

Summary:

The main function of a DevOps engineer is to abstract, maintain, and evolve shared infrastructure-SDLC tooling, hosting (compute/observability/availability), and service infrastructure (secrets, databases, etc.)-so product teams can ship faster with higher reliability. Our purpose is to make infrastructure easy and safe for service developers by delivering paved roads, automation, and guidance.

Job Responsibilities:

- Design and build platform capabilities that standardize deployment, networking, identity, and runtime fundamentals across services (AKS, ingress, service mesh, traffic management).

- Automate infrastructure as code (Terraform) and harden CI/CD (Azure DevOps/YAML) to reduce toil and raise change quality.

- Manage reliability at scale: create actionable alerting, dashboards, and TSGs;

- Coordinate migrations, changes and implement guardrails via shared modules, guides, and partner enablement.

- Improve day 2 operations with policy, access, and identity automation and codify telemetry queries into monitoring.

- Collaborate broadly with platform, security, and service teams-driving design reviews and documentation.

Skills:

- 4+ years building and operating distributed systems or platforms in cloud environments (Azure preferred).

- Proficiency in infrastructure as code and CI/CD (Terraform; Azure DevOps YAML)

- Hands on with Kubernetes/AKS, container networking, and service routing (Ingress, service mesh).

Marvell's semiconductor solutions are the essential building blocks of the data infrastructure that connects our world. Across enterprise, cloud and AI, and carrier architectures, our innovative technology is enabling new possibilities.

At Marvell, you can affect the arc of individual lives, lift the trajectory of entire industries, and fuel the transformative potential of tomorrow. For those looking to make their mark on purposeful and enduring innovation, above and beyond fleeting trends, Marvell is a place to thrive, learn, and lead.

Your Team, Your Impact

As an Analog Layout Senior Staff Engineer with Marvell, you'll be a member of the Central Engineering business group. If you picture Marvell as a wheel, Central Engineering is the center hub providing IP to be used by all the other spokes on that wheel, including Automotive, Storage, Security, and Networking. You'll be part of a small analog team making a big impact on this organization. Additionally, Marvell has the perfect size and scale for you to learn several aspects of engineering that will be new to you, but also have the time and freedom to dive deep into the details of your specialization on most projects.



Working with global teams across Argentina, Singapore, the U.S., and Europe, you will run simulations and verifications using Cadence Virtuoso, collaborating closely with the designer to refine and debug iteratively until the design meets specifications. Project durations vary from a few months to a year and a half with flexibility to switch based on changing priorities is appreciated.

Regular meetings with your paired designer ensure collaborative information sharing, integral to Marvell's commitment to partnership and teamwork. As a key contributor, you play a crucial role in the project lifecycle, participating in routine meetings as a technical mentor, layout team, and the broader project team. These interactions include updates on progress and may involve presenting specific issues or solutions encountered during the development of cutting-edge technologies. The dynamic nature of our work ensures continuous learning and knowledge-sharing among colleagues.



To be successful in this role, you must:
- Have fundamental understanding of electrical concepts, likely acquired through a degree in Electrical Engineering (graduate or undergraduate).
- Know how to use CAD tools to do the implementation layers, microelectronic layers in design that go beyond the schematics.
- Track record of delivering high-speed or precision analog circuits, preferably in multiple process nodes
- Have ownership through the full development cycle: floorplan, layout, verification, delivery, and support
- Assume more responsibility and ownership of tasks, from cells to functional blocks, to higher-level macros, to full interfaces or chips
- Have excellent communication skills to give status updates to your team, present to global teams in different time zones, and to share information with many different levels of personnel at Marvell

At Marvell, we offer a total compensation package with a base, bonus and equity.Health and financial wellbeing are part of the package.
