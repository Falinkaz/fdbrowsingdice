Front End Developer,Apex Systems,,"Arden Hills, MN",Full Time,,,,,,,,,On Site,"Job#: 3014161

Job Description:

Apex Systems is partnering with one of our top Medical Device clients to find a talented Front End Developer to join their growing team in St. Paul, MN.

If you're looking for a role where you can make an impact, grow your skills, and work with a respected organization-this could be the perfect fit!

Front End Developer

Our client is looking for an outstanding, experienced, and independent frontend developer to develop, create, and maintain internal business tools and applications. This position is joining a newly created group, one that operates as a smaller company within the greater orginization, to develop and deliver internal tools and apps that deliver new capabilities and drive the business forward to the future. This group has a startup feel with a high amount of visibility and opportunities. We are looking for someone to help us further establish this group and make their own mark on the group and business. We utilize an MVP (minimal viable product) mentality/methodology and expect you to know when it's ""good enough for now"" without sacrificing the long term vision or costing massive rework.

This frontend developer will have a proven history of:

1. Taking ownership of projects and working independently - you will own developing, writing, testing, and deployment of code with limited direction and oversight. Doing this with as few bugs as possible will be critical for success in this role.

2. Completing tasks and projects quickly and 'correctly' - meaning commenting, testing, and all other documentation while still hitting deadlines. You must be methodical and detail oriented in the face of rapidly changing demands.

3. Communicating and Collaborating with cross-functional teams - bring your technical knowledge and expertise along with a 'can-do' attitude to enrich the team and guide them to the best possible solution.

Technical Skills you should be very experienced with:

Javascript (VueJS)/HTML5/CSS - this role will be focused on more frontend with minimal backend expectations. Being able to communicate what endpoint you need in order to make awesome interactive frontends for the customer.

Communicating and interacting with REST APIs (This role would be requesting & communicating almost exclusively through API endpoints)

Git (e.g. Gitlab), Pivotal Tracker, Jira, Slack, Kubernetes

Developing intuitive user interfaces/experiences (UI/UX), with cross-browser compatibility, general web functions and standards (e.g. Bootstrap)

Test Driven Development (TTD)

Soft Skills that will be critical for success:

Strong Communication and Collaboration skills - you'll be working with a multitude of customers, all with differing roles, levels, and experience with software development. Being able to clearly communicate ideas and collaborate with those customers is a must.

Ability to learn and adapt - this role will have many unexpected challenges and you must able to learn new skillsets and methodologies to overcome these challenges.

Other good things to be knowledgeable about:

MVP (minimal viable product) and what that means to you and your customer.

Being a full-stack developer or at least knowledgeable enough to detail what data needs to be exposed

Software development methodologies (e.g. Scrum) and tools (e.g. Kanban boards)

VueJS framework for awesome interactive frontends

Candidates with previous project and example code portfolios will be given (much) higher consideration.
