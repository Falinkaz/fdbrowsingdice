Marketing Analytics,Apex Systems,,"Bellevue, WA",Full Time,,,,,,,,,On Site,"Job#: 3015543

Job Description:

About the Team:

The Web Experience team is responsible for the strategy, measurement, and optimization of marketing surfaces. We partner closely with product marketing, brand, and demand generation to experiment, measure, and continuously improve how users discover and adopt products.

We're looking for a marketing analytics contractor who loves solving ambiguous problems with data, is comfortable working across multiple data sources (e.g. FullStory/behavioral analytics, SQL, PowerBI, ADX), and can turn vague business questions into clear, actionable insights.

This contractor will collaborate closely with the Web Experience Product Manager and Director to support analytics across marketing programs, experiments, and broader site performance.

What You'll Do:

As the web & marketing analyst for the Web Experience team, you will own a range of measurement, reporting, and investigation workflows.

Core Responsibilities:

- Evaluate the impact of web projects (cross-team initiatives)-both proactively and in response to stakeholder requests.

- Run and evaluate web experiments using tools like Ninetailed and internal frameworks.

- Use our behavioral analytics tool, FullStory, to assess the impact of web design on engagement and usability. Track user journeys and funnels.

- Use FullStory and PowerBI to answer ad-hoc questions about user behavior, funnel performance, and marketing program impact.

- Produce monthly reporting on web engagement, including session patterns, behavioral insights, and page-level trends.

- Collaborate with product mangers and marketers to clarify vague or exploratory analytics questions and translate them into structured analyses.

- Execute page-level and flow-level investigations to identify issues or opportunities across purchase and conversion paths.

- Work with Marketing Operations to analyze sales funnels from web lead sources.

Required Skills:

- 5-7+ years experience in web analytics and/or marketing analytics.

- Experience with Google Analytics (or similar web analytics platforms) for tracking, reporting, and interpreting user behavior and performance metrics.

- Ability to take ambiguous or loosely framed questions and refine them into structured analytical approaches.

- Advanced Excel skills, including pivot tables, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, and data manipulation for analysis.

- Experience supporting marketing teams, growth teams, or web teams in understanding performance.

- Proficiency in A/B testing methodologies-including experiment design, implementation, and results interpretation-with a strong understanding of statistical concepts such as power, significance, and confidence intervals.

- Strong communication skills, especially the ability to distill findings into clear, actionable recommendations.

- Comfort context-switching across multiple stakeholders and incoming requests.

- Ability to work independently and manage one's time.

Nice-to-Have:

- Hands-on experience with FullStory or other behavioral analytics tool.

- Proficiency with SQL and comfort querying large datasets.

- Experience with experiment platforms (e.g., Ninetailed, Optimizely, LaunchDarkly).

- Familiarity with BI tools like Power BI, Looker, or Tableau.

- Understanding of SEO analytics, documentation analytics, or logged-in behavior measurement.

- Experience with developer-focused products (bonus, not required).

Success in This Role Looks Like:

- Marketing teams get faster, clearer insights with less ambiguity.

- Web experiments are run and evaluated smoothly with reliable, repeatable methods.

- Monthly reporting becomes more comprehensive and easier to use.

- FullStory investigations uncover meaningful behavioral gaps and opportunities.

- The team gains confidence in measurement for marketing campaigns, site changes, and cross-org initiatives.

This fully remote role offers flexibility and meaningful analytical work. A typical day includes:

- Monitoring data for outages, anomalies, or performance shifts

- 1.5 hours of collaboration with stakeholders and teammates

- Project work such as building dashboards, pivoting Excel datasets, writing layperson-friendly analyses, supporting experiments, and documenting new opportunities

- Insight exploration time to investigate trends and uncover new opportunities - a chance to showcase your analytical and storytelling strengths

- Fully remote role

- High-impact work with opportunities to communicate insights clearly to non-technical leaders

- Ability to demonstrate both analytical depth and strong written communication

- Incredible brand culture
