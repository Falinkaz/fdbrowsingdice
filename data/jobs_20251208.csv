"Carbon Markets, Data Specialist - 12-month contract",Bloomberg L.P.,,"New York, NY",Full Time,,,,,,,,USD 68.00 - 77.00 per hour,On Site,"Description & Requirements

The Climate Data Steering Committee (CDSC) was established in 2022 by French President Emmanuel Macron and United Nations Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions Michael R. Bloomberg. Chaired by Mary Schapiro, the CDSC brings together global policymakers, regulators, and international organizations, informed by data providers and civil society, to improve access to standardized climate data.

Under the South African G20 Presidency, the Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG) identified unlocking the financing potential of carbon markets as one of its three priorities for 2025, with a particular focus on improving carbon credit data standardization. As the Lead Knowledge Partner for this priority, the CDSC oversaw the development of the Common Carbon Credit Data Model ('the Data Model'). The Data Model provides guidance on standardization of key data fields across the carbon credit lifecycle, from pre-issuance to retirement.

The CDSC Secretariat is now piloting and testing the Data Model with interested jurisdictions and market participants.



We are looking for an experienced Data Specialist to join our team and support work to pilot the Data Model with carbon market participants such as registries, exchanges, and project developers for example, as well as with policymakers and regulators. The candidate would ideally have some knowledge of carbon markets and the opportunities and challenges relating to data standardization.










Salary Range = 68 - 77 USD Hourly

The referenced salary range is based on the Company's good faith belief at the time of posting. Actual compensation may vary based on factors such as geographic location, work experience, market conditions, education/training and skill level.

We offer one of the most comprehensive and generous benefits plans available and offer a range of total rewards that may include merit increases, incentive compensation (exempt roles only), paid holidays, paid time off, medical, dental, vision, short and long term disability benefits, 401(k) +match, life insurance, and various wellness programs, among others.
