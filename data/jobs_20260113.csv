Title / Position: Process Execution Analyst

Location: Charlotte, NC
Remote/Hybrid allowance: 4x/week onsite, 1/week remote

Contract Duration: 3-6 month C2H

Top Requirements:
Supply chain background



This Process Execution Analyst position will sit on a team within Supply Chain organization. This team is, in part, responsible for standardizing the purchase order process to ensure a lack of redundancy, that orders are not placed in massive quantity, that controlled products are not being ordered by groups without authorization and that discontinued products are not being purchased. There are metrics/goals aligned to many of the products, including weeks of supply, min/max levels, etc. Having a background in inventory best practices would be helpful. Additionally, this person will handle compliance as related to purchase order changes - ensuring that when an order is changed, that it still meets the company needs. There will be a decision tree available to guide the decisions this analyst needs to make. The team has about a 60% rejection rate and has saved the company over $80 million, however, this has been a massive shift in company process over the last few years - people who previously were able to order anything they wanted are being challenged. This role will also include copious communication to help the business understand and problem solve through their inventory challenges.

IT Project Manager (Agile - Infrastructure Focus),Apex Systems,,"Richmond, VA",Full Time,,,,,,,,,On Site,"Job#: 3017692

Job Description:

IT Project Manager (Agile - Infrastructure Focus)

Job Summary:

The IT Project Manager will coordinate and deliver projects within the Information Technology department, with a strong emphasis on infrastructure initiatives. This role functions as a PM/delivery manager operating within an Agile environment.

Job Duties:

This position establishes and implements project management processes and methodologies to ensure projects are delivered on time, within budget, and to high quality standards. The PM will manage both technical and non-technical aspects of infrastructure-focused projects, including servers, telephony, hardware, operating systems, security, cloud, and select on-prem technologies. Responsibilities include planning, scheduling, resource allocation, and day-to-day oversight of project execution.

The role serves as a liaison between project teams, leadership, and cross-functional groups, ensuring alignment across multiple hubs. This individual will also oversee the scrum masters supporting infrastructure teams, providing coaching, mentorship, and guidance on Agile best practices.



The environment is an Agile shop with teams at varying levels of maturity. While the PM will not serve as a Scrum Master, they must possess a strong Agile mindset and a clear understanding of the differences between frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, etc.). Infrastructure teams primarily operate within a Kanban model, though Scrum teams exist. The PM will focus on project delivery, process improvement, and cross-team coordination rather than facilitating daily stand-ups.

Experience with Jira and dashboards is preferred, along with the ability to develop and track KPIs. A high-level understanding of switching and routing is also desired.



This role operates under minimal supervision and handles complex issues, escalating only the most advanced challenges. Candidates must possess comprehensive subject-matter knowledge and demonstrate leadership, coaching, and mentoring capabilities.
